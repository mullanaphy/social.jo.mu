[social.john.mu](https://social.john.mu/)
================================================================================

An extension of my personal blog at [john.mu](john.mu) this links to all of my
social media accounts and allows me to utilize subdomains for forwarding instead
of the social media's url. That way if I ever change usernames I just have to
change the username in one location (this repo) instead of updating all sites
that point to the original username.
